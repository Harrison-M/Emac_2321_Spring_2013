### EMAC 2321 Writing and Research For New Media

### Spring 2012

### Syllabus Website

#### Course Description

Digital media play an extremely important role in contemporary writing
and research techniques. In fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that
all writing and research are now digital! However, the platforms and
technologies that make up digital media are constantly changing and
shifting. Anyone who only learns writing and research techniques tied
too closely to a single platform is likely to find that these skills
rapidly go out of date. This course, *Writing and Research for New
Media*, seeks to avoid this pitfall by helping students learn broad,
transferable skills that will help them use current platforms
successfully, and adapt to new platforms as they emerge. As such, this
course stresses the *process*of learning over rote memorization!
Students are expected to experiment with techniques, and learn to be
comfortable exploring new platforms and tools.

This syllabus website is the best way for students to keep up to date
with course readings, policies and assignments. See the links below for
more information. You can download a [pdf version of this
syllabus (for printing and reading)](http://copyvillain.org/ATEC_2321_MATERIALS/EMAC_2321_Fall_2012_Syllabus.pdf) or [an epub version of this syllabus (for smartphones and ereaders)](htttp://copyvillain.org/ATEC_2321_MATERIALS/EMAC_2321_Fall_2012_Syllabus.epub). Just remember that the pdf and epub versions will
not be updated as regularly as the syllabus website! If the other
versions and website version of the syllabus disagree *the web version is
correct.*

All students must fill out the [Day One Prep Assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHM4OFJJeXpDR19FWmlsdC1CWEVITXc6MQ#gid=0)! Failure to do so will negatively impact your digital participation score!
