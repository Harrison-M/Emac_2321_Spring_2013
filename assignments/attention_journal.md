## Attention Journal Assignment

We'll start our class by learning to think critically about how we apply our attention online. We've all read cautionary tales about the possibilities of distraction on the Internet. Howard Rheingold believes that distraction is indeed a danger, but fast-moving streams of information we encounter when using New Media can also be an opportunity! How can we maximize the opportunities while minimizing the risks? 

Rheingold argues we can do this if we hone our attention skills. To start to do this, we have to begin to _pay attention to attention._ That is to say, we have to learn to consciously notice, and reflect on, how we are switching and maintaining our focus. 

To begin the process of learning to consciously noticing and shaping our attention, we will complete a brief attention journal assignment. The attention journal is designed to give students a chance to think critically about their own attention practices, and begin to refine them using techniques we will discuss in class. 

### Part One: Initial Reflection 

Pick a two-hour period out of your day when you will be engaged with digital media. During this two-hour period, note every time you shift what you are paying attention to. For example, if you break away from writing a document to check facebook, note this, and if you then stop reading your facebook feed to read something a friend linked to, note this as well! Note when you switch applications on your computer, and when you open a new browser tab (or switch between tabs). Note any time you stop paying attention to the computer to have an in-person conversation, listen to the radio or watch TV, check your phone, or even just day-dream. Try to become aware of what it *feels like* to shift your attention and notice it whenever and however it happens.

Your goal here is not to change your behavior, not yet, just to notice how you behave. Try to act naturally, and keep your journal without passing any judgment on how you act. 

You may keep your notes in any format you wish, so try to choose a method that will be easy and natural for you. Some may want to take notes on a piece of paper, others will want to open a text editor on their computer, or keep notes on a tablet or smart phone. Don't let the note-taking process itself take up too much of your attention!

Submit your complete journal, along with a brief (100-200 word) reflection on the experience of making it, to the instructor via the elearning system prior to 111:59pm Sunday, September 9. 

### Part Two: Applying Techniques 

Select another two-hour period when you will be engaged with digital media. This time, reflect a little on your media habits before hand and plan to try to use some of the techniques and tools we discussed in class to shape your attention and manage distractions. Once again, spend the two hour period paying close attention to your attention, and noticing when you change focus. 

When you complete your journal, write up a brief (200-350 word) reflection on your experiences. Try to respond to the following questions: 

- How did your attention patterns change after you employed the techniques and tools we discussed in class? In what ways were the new patterns more or less effective for you?
- What *attention failure modes* are you prone to? How will you attempt to mitigate these in the future? 
- What other techniques or tools might you want to try to further shape your attention and why?
