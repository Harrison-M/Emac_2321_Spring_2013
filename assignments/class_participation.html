<p>In-class participation is a crucial part of learning in this class, and a key part of your class grade! You are expected to be in class, prepared and engaged for every class meeting. Be sure to read the absence policy explained in &quot;Be In Class&quot; on the <a href="http://copyvillain.org/blog/emac-2012-course-policies/">course policies page</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, specific expectations for student class participation are outlined below.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-participation-10">Discussion Participation (10%)</h3>
<p>Students should come to every class meeting ready to discuss the reading or pre-class exercise assigned for the day. To prepare for discussion, carefully read the assigned material, or complete the pre-class exercise prior to the class meeting.</p>
<p>During the class meeting, be prepared to discuss questions asked by the instructor and respond to ideas introduced by your classmates. <em>Be bold!</em> Remember, discussion isn't about being right or showing how clever you are. Discussion should be an experiment, where everyone can try out different ideas and see how they work. As long as your contributions to discussion show that you are prepared for our class meeting, they will be successful!</p>
<p>In addition, there will often be small exercises or in-class activities during our class meetings. To receive full credit for the class participation assignment, students must be engaged participants in these in-class activities.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation:</h4>
<p>Participation is worth 15% of the class grade. You will be assigned half of the participation grade at mid-semester and half at the end of the semester. Participation will be evaluated based on the following simple rubric.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excellent Participation:</strong> The student is always attentive and alert in class. The student makes substantial contributions to every class discussion. The student's contributions always demonstrate that he or she has done the required reading or pre-class exercise. The student's contributions often demonstrate his or her original thought. The student is an active participant in all in-class activities, often taking a leadership role in group activities.</li>
<li><strong>Good Participation:</strong> The student is always attentive and alert in class. The student makes substantial contributions to most class discussions (at least once per week). The student's contributions always demonstrate that he or she has done the required reading or pre-class exercises. The student plays an active role during in-class activities.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfactory Participation:</strong> The student is usually attentive and alert in class. The student makes substantial contributions to at least a few class discussions. The student's contributions usually demonstrate that he or she has done the required reading or pre-class activity. The student is sometimes not an active participant during in-class activities.</li>
<li><strong>Less than Satisfactory Participation:</strong> The student is inattentive in class. The student rarely makes substantial contributions to class discussions. The student's contributions strongly suggest he or she has not done the required reading or pre-class activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workshop-participation-10">Workshop Participation (10%)</h3>
<p>Two <em>blog workshops</em> will be held during this class. Each workshop will be a class day dedicated to pairs of students discussing their progress on the blog assignment and giving each other constructive criticism. The first workshop will focus on the blog proposal, giving students a chance to get peer feedback on their blog topics and examples prior to starting the blog project. The second workshop will be a final reflection on and audit of the blog project, giving students a chance to think about where they succeeded in the project and what they still need to learn.</p>
<p>Details for the blog workshop assignment will be posted here well prior to the first workshop meeting (Tuesday, September 25).</p>
<p>Students will be evaluated on their workshop performance <em>both</em> by the instructor and by their workshop partner, so be sure to give good, conscienscious feedback!</p>
<h3 id="platform-presentation-5">Platform Presentation (5%)</h3>
<p>During the closing weeks of class we will discuss how New Media writing is often spread across a wide variety of technical <em>platforms.</em> Being effective writers in the New Media enviroment requires that we be able to think critically about these platforms, their technological affordances, legal relationships with authors and audiences, and social norms. Students will be split into groups and tasked with collectively researching a variety of platforms and preparing a 15-20 minute presentation on their findings, to be given in the last week of class.</p>
<p>Further details will be posted here as the start date of this assignment approaches.</p>
